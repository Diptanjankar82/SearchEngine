# SearchEngine

SearchEngine is a web application project consisting of three main components: front end, back end, and a database. The goal of this project is to create a search engine that allows users to search for information stored in a database.

## Technology Stack

- **Front End:**
  - HTML: Responsible for creating the structure of the web page.
  - CSS: Used for styling the web page, including elements such as background color, font color, and alignment.

- **Back End:**
  - Java Servlets: Used for handling requests and responses between the front end and the database.
  - JSP (Java Server Pages): Allows Java code to be written inside HTML files, enabling dynamic content generation.

- **Database:**
  - MySQL: A popular database management system used for storing and interacting with data.

## Project Structure

- **Front End:** Contains HTML and CSS files for creating the user interface.
- **Back End:** Consists of Java Servlets and JSP files for handling server-side logic and connecting with the database.
- **Database:** Stores data and interacts with the back end to retrieve and manipulate information.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up MySQL database and configure the connection details in the back end code.
3. Deploy the back end on a servlet container like Apache Tomcat.
4. Access the application through a web browser to perform searches and interact with the data.
